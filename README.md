# YOLO-V3 Object detection algorithm in PyTorch

This repository contains code for a object detector based on YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement, implementedin PyTorch. The code is based on the official code of YOLO v3, as well as a PyTorch port of the original code, by marvis. 


## Requirements 
1. Python 3.5
2. OpenCV
3. PyTorch 0.4

I have run the algorithm on a traffic video. Here is how it worked.
